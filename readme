Introduction
Deep Learning (DL) methods based on the graph are widely used in code vulnerability detection. However, the existing studies focus on employing contextual value in the graph, which ignores the heterogeneous relations (i.e., the relations between different nodes and edges types). In addition, subject to a large number of nodes, current methods lack the ability to capture the long-range dependencies in the code graph (i.e., the relationship between distant nodes). These limitations may obstruct the learning of vulnerable code patterns. In this paper, we propose MAGNET, a Meta-path based Attentional Graph learning model for code vulNErability deTection. We design a multi-granularity meta-path to consider the heterogeneous relations between different node and edge types to better learn the structural information in the graph. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level attentional graph neural network called MHAGNN, which considers the heterogeneous relations and exploits the long-range dependencies between distant nodes. Comprehensive experimental results on three public benchmarks show that MAGNET achie
